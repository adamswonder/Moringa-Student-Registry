## Description

This is a web based which enables students be able to log in only if their location matches the marked Moringa School premises. The student then signs in to the system and gets access to the dashboard entailing check-in, check-out and a reminder to always track health status by the help of the already implemented health check form. It will also have links to student support communication channels for easier management.
